# GlobalReach

Global Reach is an ios based application created by myself and a group of UTS students using swift as part of an Assignment in ios development.
It is an applicaiton which provides real time data of currency exchange rates as well as currency conversion. It is aimed at international students,
ensuring that they know that the exchange rate they are getting when converting money is fair.
The zip contains another readme file which gives instructions on how to run the application.
